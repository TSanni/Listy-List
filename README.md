# Listy To Do List
A Todo List application for iOS devices with themes and In-App purchase functionality.

On the surface this project is a simple todo list. 
However, there is added functionality that sets it apart from a simple todo app. 
With this project, there is a functionality to pin certain categories that the user would prefer to see constantly. 
The user would use the button in the toolbar to add either categories or items. 
There is a settings screen that allows the user to change the theme of the app. And for extra 
functionality, there is an in-app purchase option where users can buy more themes

- SwiftUI
